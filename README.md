- **Assists**: Number of assists  
- **Minutes Played**  
- **Result**: Match outcome (W/D/L)

## Environment Setup
The analysis uses the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` – for data handling  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for static visualizations  
- `plotly` – for interactive charts  
- `numpy` – for numerical operations  

## Data Wrangling
Steps performed:
- Cleaned and standardized columns  
- Converted dates into proper formats  
- Handled any missing or inconsistent data  
- Created new metrics (e.g., Goals per 90 mins, Contributions per Match)
